<h1><p class='center'>VIGILANCE</p></h1>
<p><em>We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again:  “Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.” Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.</em>

<p><br><br>
Today I am an alcoholic. Tomorrow will be no different.  My alcoholism lives within me now and forever. I must never forget what I am. Alcohol will surely kill me if I fail to recognize and acknowledge my disease on a daily basis. I am not playing a game in which a loss is a temporary setback. I am dealing with my disease, for which there is no cure, only daily acceptance and vigilance.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>“I WAS AN EXCEPTION”</p></h1>
<p><em>He [Bill W.] said to me, gently and simply, “Do you think that you are one of us?”</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 413</p>
<p><br><br>
During my drinking life I was convinced I was an exception.  I thought I was beyond petty requirements and had the right to be excused. I never realized that the dark counterbalance of my attitude was the constant feeling that I did not “belong.” At first, in A.A., I identified with others only as an alcoholic. What a wonderful awakening for me it has been to realize that, if human beings were doing the best they could, then so was I! All of the pains, confusions and joys they feel are not exceptional, but part of my life, just as much as anybody’s.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE LAST PROMISE</p></h1>
<p><em>We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84</p>
<p><br><br>
The last Promise in the Big Book came true for me on the very first day of sobriety. God kept me sober that day, and on every other day I allowed Him to operate in my life. He gives me the strength, courage and guidance to meet my responsibilities in life so that I am then able to reach out and help others stay sober and grow. He manifests within me, making me a channel of His word, thought and deed. He works with my inner self, while I produce in the outer world, for He will not do for me what I can do for myself. I must be willing to do His work, so that He can function through me successfully.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>H.P. AS GUIDE</p></h1>
<p><em>See to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great events will come to pass for you and countless others. This is the Great Fact for us.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 164</p>
<p><br><br>
Having a right relationship with God seemed to be an impossible order. My chaotic past had left me filled with guilt and remorse and I wondered how this “God business” could work. A.A. told me that I must turn my will and my life life over to the care of God, as I understand Him. With nowhere else to turn, I went down on my knees and cried, “God, I can’t do this. Please help me!” It was when I admitted my powerlessness that a glimmer of light began to touch my soul, and then a willingness emerged to let God control my life. With Him as my guide, great events began to happen, and I found the beginning of sobriety.</p>

<p><a href=days/240919.html>240919</a></p>
<h1><p class='center'>ACCEPTANCE</p></h1>
<p><em>We admitted we couldn’t lick alcohol with our own remaining resources, and so we accepted the further fact that dependence upon a Higher Power (if only our A.A. group) could do this hitherto impossible job. The moment we were able to accept these facts fully, our release from the alcohol compulsion had begun.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-AS BILL SEES IT, p. 109</p>
<p><br><br>
Freedom came to me only with my acceptance that I could turn my will and my life over to the care of my Higher Power, whom I call God. Serenity seeped into the chaos of my life when I accepted that what I was going through was life, and that God would help me through my difficulties–and much more, as well. Since then He has helped me through all of my difficulties! When I accept situations as they are, not as I wish them to be, then I can begin to grow and have serenity and peace of mind.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>LOVED BACK TO RECOVERY</p></h1>
<p><em>Our whole treasured philosophy of self-sufficiency had to be cast aside. This had not been done with old-fashioned willpower; it was instead a matter of developing the willingness to accept these new facts of living. We neither ran nor fought. But accept we did. And then we were free.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-BEST OF THE GRAPEVINE, Vol. I, p. 198</p>
<p><br><br>
I can be free of my old enslaving self. After a while I recognize, and believe in, the good within myself. I see that I have been loved back to recovery by my Higher Power, who envelops me. My Higher Power becomes that source of love and strength that is performing a continuing miracle in me. I am sober … and I am grateful.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p><a href=days/240917.html>240917</a></p>
<h1><p class='center'>FREEDOM FROM FEAR</p></h1>
<p><em>When, with God’s help, we calmly accepted our lot, then we found we could live at peace with ourselves and show others who still suffered the same fears that they could get over them, too. We found that freedom from fear was more important than freedom from want.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 122</p>
<p><br><br>
Material values ruled my life for many years during my active alcoholism. I believed that all of my possessions would make me happy, yet I still felt bankrupt after I obtained them. When I first came into A. A., I found out about a new way of living.  As a result of learning to trust others, I began to believe in a power greater than myself. Having faith freed me from the bondage of self. As material gains were replaced by the gifts of the spirit, my life became manageable. I then chose to share my experiences with other alcoholics.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p><a href=days/240916.html>240916</a></p>
<h1><p class='center'>WE STAND–OR FALL–TOGETHER</p></h1>
<p><em>… no society of men and women ever had a more urgent need for continuous effectiveness and permanent unity. We alcoholics see that we must work together and hang together, else most of us will finally die alone.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-Alcoholics Anonymous, p.563</p>
<p><br><br>
Just as the Twelve Steps of A.A. are written in a specific sequence for a reason, so it is with the Twelve Traditions. The First Step and the First Tradition attempt to instill in me enough humility to allow me a chance at survival. Together they are the basic foundation upon which the Steps and Traditions that follow are built. It is a process of ego deflation which allows me to grow as an individual through the Steps, and as a contributing member of a group through the Traditions. Full acceptance of the First Tradition allows me to set aside personal ambitions, fears and anger when they are in conflict with the common good, thus permitting me to work with others for our mutual survival.  Without Tradition One I stand little chance of maintaining the unity required to work with others effectively, and I also stand to lose the remaining Traditions, the Fellowship, and my life.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>A NEW LIFE</p></h1>
<p><em>Yes, there is a substitute and it is vastly more than that.  It is a fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous. Life will mean something at last.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 152</p>
<p><br><br>
Life is better without alcohol. A.A. and the presence of a Higher Power keeps me sober, but the grace of God does even better; it brings service into my life. Contact with the A.A. program teaches me a new and greater understanding of what Alcoholics Anonymous is and what it does, but most importantly, it helps to show me who I am: an alcoholic who needs the constant experience of the Alcoholics Anonymous program so that I may live a life given to me by my Higher Power.</p>
