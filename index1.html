<h1><p class='center'>“OUR SIDE OF THE STREET”</p></h1>
<p><em>We are there to sweep off our side of the street, realizing that nothing worth while can be accomplished until we do so, never trying to tell him what he should do. His faults are not discussed. We stick to our own.</em>

I made amends to my dad after I quit drinking. My words fell on deaf ears since I had blamed him for my troubles. Several months later I made amends to my dad again. This time I wrote a letter in which I did not blame him nor mention his faults. It worked, and at last I understood! My side of the street is all that I’m responsible for and–thanks to God and A.A.– it’s clean for today.</p>

<p><br><br>
When I survey my drinking days, I recall many people whom my life touched casually, but whose days I troubled through my anger and sarcasm. These people are untraceable, and direct amends to them are not possible. The only amends I can make to those untraceable individuals, the only “changes for the better” I can offer, are indirect amends made to other people, whose paths briefly cross mine. Courtesy and kindness, regularly practiced, help me to live in emotional balance, at peace with myself.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>RECONSTRUCTION</p></h1>
<p><em>Yes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS , p. 83</p>
<p><br><br>
The reconstruction of my life is the prime goal in my recovery as I avoid taking that first drink, one day at a time. The task is most successfully accomplished by working the Steps of our Fellowship. The spiritual life is not a theory; it works, but I have to live it. Step Two started me on my journey to develop a spiritual life; Step Nine allows me to move into the final phase of the initial Steps which taught me how to live a spiritual life. Without the guidance and strength of a Higher Power, it would be impossible to proceed through the various stages of reconstruction. I realize that God works for me and through me. Proof comes to me when I realize that God did for me what I could not do for myself, by removing that gnawing compulsion to drink. I must continue daily to seek God’s guidance. He grants me a daily reprieve and will provide the power I need for reconstruction.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>BUILDING A NEW LIFE, p.255</p></h1>
<p><em>We feel a man is unthinking when he says sobriety is enough.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-Alcoholics Anonymous, p.82</p>
<p><br><br>
When I reflect on Step Nine, I see that physical sobriety must be enough for me. I need to remember the hopelessness I felt before  I found sobriety, and how I was willing to go to any lengths for it. Physical sobriety is not enough for those around me, however, since I must see that God’s gift is used to build a new life for my family and loved ones. Just as importantly, I must be available to help others who want the A.A. way of life. I ask God to help me share the gift of sobriety so that its benefit may be shown to those I know and love.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>FINDING “A REASON TO BELIEVE”</p></h1>
<p><em>The willingness to grow is the essence of all spiritual development.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-As Bill Sees It, p.171</p>
<p><br><br>
A line from a song goes, “ … and I look to find a reason to believe … ” It reminds me that at one time I was not able to find a reason to believe that my life was all right. Even though my life had been saved by coming to A.A., three months later I went out and drank again. Someone told me: “You don’t have to believe. Aren’t you willing to believe that there is a reason for your life, even though you may not know yourself what that reason is, or that you may not sometimes know the right way to behave?” When I saw how willing I was to believe there was a reason for my life, then I could start to work on the Steps. Now when I begin with, “I am willing … ,” I am using the key that leads to action, honesty, and openness to a Higher Power moving through my life.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>WILLINGNESS TO GROW</p></h1>
<p><em>If more gifts are to be received, our awakening has to go on.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-As Bill Sees It, p.8</p>
<p><br><br>
Sobriety fills the painful “hole in the soul” that my alcoholism created. Often I feel so physically well that I believe my work is done. However, joy is not just the absence of pain; it is the gift of continued spiritual awakening. Joy comes from ongoing and active study, as well as application of the principles of recovery in my everyday life, and from sharing that experience with others. My Higher Power presents many opportunities for deeper spiritual awakening. I need only to bring into my recovery the willingness to grow. Today I am ready to grow.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>A UNIQUE PROGRAM</p></h1>
<p><em>Alcoholics Anonymous will never have a professional class. We have gained some understanding of the ancient words “Freely ye have received, freely give.” We have discovered that at the point of professionalism, money and spirituality do not mix.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 166</p>
<p><br><br>
I believe that Alcoholics Anonymous stands alone in the treatment of alcoholism because it is based solely on the principle of one alcoholic sharing with another alcoholic. This is what makes the program unique. When I decided that I wanted to stay sober, I called a woman who I knew was a sober member of A.A., and she carried the message of Alcoholics Anonymous to me. She received no monetary compensation, but rather was paid by staying sober another day herself. Today I could ask for no payment other than another day free from alcohol, so in that respect, I am generously paid for my labor.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE ONLY REQUIREMENT …</p></h1>
<p><em>“At one time. . .every A.A. group had many membership rules.  Everybody was scared witless that something or somebody would capsize the boat. . .The total list was a mile long. If all those rules had been in effect everywhere, nobody could have possibly joined A.A. at all.”</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 139-40</p>
<p><br><br>
I’m grateful that the Third Tradition only requires of me a desire to stop drinking. I had been breaking promises for years. In the Fellowship I didn’t have to make promises, I didn’t have to concentrate. It only required my attending one meeting, in a foggy condition, to know I was home. I didn’t have to pledge undying love. Here, strangers hugged me. “It gets better,” they said, and “One day at a time, you can do it.” They were no longer strangers, but caring friends. I ask God to help me to reach out to people desiring sobriety, and to, please, keep me grateful!</p>

<h1><p class='center'>I CHOOSE ANONYMITY</p></h1>
<p><em>We are sure that humility, expressed by anonymity, is the greatest safeguard that Alcoholics Anonymous can ever have.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-12 &amp; 12, p.187</p>
<p><br><br>
Since there are no rules in A.A. I place myself where I want to be, and so I choose anonymity. I want my God to use me, humbly, as one of His tools in this program. Sacrifice is the art of giving of myself freely, allowing humility to replace my ego. With sobriety,  I suppress that urge to cry out to the world, “I am a member of A.A.” and I experience inner joy and peace. I let people see the changes in me and hope they will ask what happened to me. I place the principles of spirituality ahead of judging, fault-finding, and criticism. I want love and caring in my group, so I can grow.</p>
