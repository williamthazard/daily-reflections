<h1><p class='center'>RECONSTRUCTION</p></h1>
<p><em>Yes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS , p. 83</p>
<p><br><br>
The reconstruction of my life is the prime goal in my recovery as I avoid taking that first drink, one day at a time. The task is most successfully accomplished by working the Steps of our Fellowship. The spiritual life is not a theory; it works, but I have to live it. Step Two started me on my journey to develop a spiritual life; Step Nine allows me to move into the final phase of the initial Steps which taught me how to live a spiritual life. Without the guidance and strength of a Higher Power, it would be impossible to proceed through the various stages of reconstruction. I realize that God works for me and through me. Proof comes to me when I realize that God did for me what I could not do for myself, by removing that gnawing compulsion to drink. I must continue daily to seek God’s guidance. He grants me a daily reprieve and will provide the power I need for reconstruction.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE ONLY REQUIREMENT …</p></h1>
<p><em>“At one time. . .every A.A. group had many membership rules.  Everybody was scared witless that something or somebody would capsize the boat. . .The total list was a mile long. If all those rules had been in effect everywhere, nobody could have possibly joined A.A. at all.”</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 139-40</p>
<p><br><br>
I’m grateful that the Third Tradition only requires of me a desire to stop drinking. I had been breaking promises for years. In the Fellowship I didn’t have to make promises, I didn’t have to concentrate. It only required my attending one meeting, in a foggy condition, to know I was home. I didn’t have to pledge undying love. Here, strangers hugged me. “It gets better,” they said, and “One day at a time, you can do it.” They were no longer strangers, but caring friends. I ask God to help me to reach out to people desiring sobriety, and to, please, keep me grateful!</p>

<h1><p class='center'>I CHOOSE ANONYMITY</p></h1>
<p><em>We are sure that humility, expressed by anonymity, is the greatest safeguard that Alcoholics Anonymous can ever have.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-12 &amp; 12, p.187</p>
<p><br><br>
Since there are no rules in A.A. I place myself where I want to be, and so I choose anonymity. I want my God to use me, humbly, as one of His tools in this program. Sacrifice is the art of giving of myself freely, allowing humility to replace my ego. With sobriety,  I suppress that urge to cry out to the world, “I am a member of A.A.” and I experience inner joy and peace. I let people see the changes in me and hope they will ask what happened to me. I place the principles of spirituality ahead of judging, fault-finding, and criticism. I want love and caring in my group, so I can grow.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>LIGHTENING THE BURDEN</p></h1>
<p><em>Showing others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. The dark past is the key to life and happiness for others.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-Alcoholics Anonymous, p.124</p>
<p><br><br>
Since I have been sober, I have been healed of many pains:  deceiving my partner, deserting my best friend, and spoiling my mother’s hopes for my life. In each case someone in the program told me of a similar problem, and I was able to share what happened to me. When my story was told, both of us got up with lighter hearts.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h1><p class='center'>CENTERING OUR THOUGHTS</p></h1>
<p><em>When World War II broke out, our A.A. dependence on a Higher Power had its first major test. A.A.’s entered the services and were scattered all over the world. Would they be able to take the discipline, stand up under fire, and endure?</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-As Bill Sees It, p.200</p>
<p><br><br>
I will center my thoughts on a Higher Power. I will surrender all to this power within me. I will become a soldier for this power, feeling the might of the spiritual army as it exists in my life today. I will allow a wave of spiritual union to connect me through my gratitude, obedience and discipline to this Higher Power. Let me allow this power to lead me through the orders of the day. May the steps I take today strengthen my words and deeds, may I know that the message I carry is mine to share, given freely by this power greater than myself.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE GIFT OF BONDING</p></h1>
<p><em>Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS , p. 63</p>
<p><br><br>
Many times in my alcoholic state, I drank to establish a bond between myself and others, but I succeeded only in establishing the bondage of alcoholic loneliness. Through the A.A. way of life, I have received the gift of bonding – with those who were there before me, with those who are there now, and with those yet to come. For this gracious gift from God, I am forever grateful.</p>
