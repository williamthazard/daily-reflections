<h1><p class='center'>PEACE OF MIND</p></h1>
<p><em>Do we lay the matter before our sponsor or spiritual adviser, earnestly asking God’s help and guidance–meanwhile resolving to do the right thing when it becomes clear, cost what it may?</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p p. 86-87</p>
<p><br><br>
My belief in a Higher Power is an essential part of my work on Step Nine; forgiveness, timing, and right motives are the other ingredients. My willingness to do the Step is a growing experience that opens the door for new and honest relationships with the people I have harmed. My responsible action brings me closer to the spiritual principles of the program — love and service. Peace of mind, serenity, and a stronger faith are sure to follow.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>REPAIRING THE DAMAGE</p></h1>
<p><em>Good judgment, careful sense of timing, courage and prudence – these are the qualities we shall need when we take Step Nine.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 83</p>
<p><br><br>
To make amends can be viewed two ways: first, that of repairing damage, for if I have damaged my neighbor’s fence, I “make a mend,” and that is a direct amend; the second way is by modifying my behavior, for if my actions have harmed someone. I make a daily effort to cause no further harm. I “mend my ways,” and that is an indirect amend. Which is the best approach? The only right approach, provided that I am causing no further harm in so doing, is to do both. If harm is done, then I simply “mend my ways.”  To take action in this manner assures me of making honest amends.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>I AM RESPONSIBLE</p></h1>
<p><em>For the readiness to take the full consequences of our past acts, and to take responsibility for the well-being of others at the same time, is the very spirit of Step Nine.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 87</p>
<p><br><br>
In recovery, and through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, I learn that the very thing I fear is my freedom. It comes from my tendency to recoil from taking responsibility for anything: I deny, I ignore, I blame, I avoid. Then one day, I look, I admit, I accept. The freedom, the healing and the recovery I experience is in the looking, admitting and accepting. I learn to say, “Yes, I am responsible.” When I can speak those words with honesty and sincerity, then I am free.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>MAKING AMENDS</p></h1>
<p><em>Above all, we should try to be absolutely sure that we are not delaying because we are afraid.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 87</p>
<p><br><br>
To have courage, to be unafraid, are gifts of my recovery. They empower me to ask for help and to go forth in making my amends with a sense of dignity and humility. Making amends may require a certain amount of honesty that I feel I lack, yet with the help of God and the wisdom of others, I can reach within and find the strength to act. My amends may be accepted, or they may not, but after they are completed I can walk with a sense of freedom and know that, for today, I am responsible.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>OPENING NEW DOORS</p></h1>
<p><em>They [the Promises] are being fulfilled among us – sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84</p>
<p><br><br>
The Promises talked about in this passage are slowly coming to life for me. What has given me hope is putting Step Nine into action. The Step has allowed me to see and set goals for myself in recovery. Old habits and behaviors die hard. Working Step Nine enables me to close the door on the drunk I was, and to open new avenues for myself as a sober alcoholic. Making direct amends is crucial for me. As I repair relationships and behavior of the past, I am better able to live a sober life! Although I have some years of sobriety, there are times when the “old stuff” from the past needs to be taken care of, and Step Nine always works, when I work it.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>“WE ASKED HIS PROTECTION”</p></h1>
<p><em>We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 59</p>
<p><br><br>
I could not manage life alone. I had tried that road and failed. My “ultimate sin” dragged me down to the lowest level I have ever reached and, unable even to function, I accepted the fact that I desperately needed help. I stopped fighting and surrendered entirely to God. Only then did I start growing! God forgave me. A Higher Power had to have saved me, because the doctors doubted that I would survive. I have forgiven myself now and I enjoy a freedom I have never before experienced. I’ve opened my heart and mind to Him. The more I learn, the less I know – a humbling fact – but I sincerely want to keep growing. I enjoy serenity, but only when I entrust my life totally to God. As long as I am honest with myself and ask for His help, I can maintain this rewarding existence. Just for today, I strive to live His will for me – soberly. I thank God that today I can choose not to drink. Today, life is beautiful!</p>

<h1><p class='center'>“OUR SIDE OF THE STREET”</p></h1>
<p><em>We are there to sweep off our side of the street, realizing that nothing worth while can be accomplished until we do so, never trying to tell him what he should do. His faults are not discussed. We stick to our own.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, pp. 77-78</p>
<p><br><br>
I made amends to my dad after I quit drinking. My words fell on deaf ears since I had blamed him for my troubles. Several months later I made amends to my dad again. This time I wrote a letter in which I did not blame him nor mention his faults. It worked, and at last I understood! My side of the street is all that I’m responsible for and–thanks to God and A.A.– it’s clean for today.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>REMOVING THREATS TO SOBRIETY</p></h1>
<p><em>… except when to do so would injure them or others.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS , p. 59</p>
<p><br><br>
Step Nine restores in me a feeling of belonging, not only to the human race but also to the everyday world. First, the Step makes me leave the safety of A.A., so that I may deal with non-A.A. people “out there,” on their terms. It is a frightening but necessary action if I am to get back into life. Second, Step Nine allows me to remove threats to my sobriety by healing past relationships. Step Nine points the way to a more serene sobriety by letting me clear away past wreckage, lest it bring me down.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>EMOTIONAL BALANCE</p></h1>
<p><em>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS , p. 83</p>
<p><br><br>
When I survey my drinking days, I recall many people whom my life touched casually, but whose days I troubled through my anger and sarcasm. These people are untraceable, and direct amends to them are not possible. The only amends I can make to those untraceable individuals, the only “changes for the better” I can offer, are indirect amends made to other people, whose paths briefly cross mine. Courtesy and kindness, regularly practiced, help me to live in emotional balance, at peace with myself.</p>
