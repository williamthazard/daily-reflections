<h1><p class='center'>KNOW GOD; KNOW PEACE</p></h1>
<p><em>It is plain that a life which includes deep resentment leads only to futility and unhappiness. . . . But with the alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth of a spiritual experience, this business of resentment is infinitely grave.</em></p>
<p class='right'>ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 66</p>
<p><br><br>
Know God;<br>
Know peace.<br>
No God;<br>
No peace.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>IT'S OKAY TO BE ME</p></h1>
<p><em>Time after time newcomers have tried to keep to themselves certain facts about their lives. . . . they have turned to easier methods. . . . But they had not learned enough humility. . . .</em></p>
<p class='right'>ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, pp. 72-73</p>
<p><br><br>
Humility sounds so much like humiliation, but it really is the ability to look at myself – and honestly accept what I find. I no longer need to be the &quot;smartest&quot; or &quot;dumbest&quot; or any other &quot;est.&quot; Finally, it is okay to be me. It is easier for me to accept myself if I share my whole life. If I cannot share in meetings, then I had better have a sponsor – someone with whom I can share those &quot;certain facts&quot; that could lead me back to a drunk, to death. I need to take all the Steps. I need the Fifth Step to learn true humility. Easier methods do not work.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE EASIER, SOFTER WAY</p></h1>
<p><em>If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.</em></p>
<p class='right'>ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 72</p>
<p><br><br>
I certainly didn't leap at the opportunity to face who I was, especially when the pains of my drinking days hung over me like a dark cloud. But I soon heard at the meetings about the fellow member who just didn't want to take Step Five and kept coming back to meetings, trembling from the horrors of reliving his past. The easier, softer way is to take these Steps to freedom from our fatal disease, and to put our faith in the Fellowship and our Higher Power.</p>
