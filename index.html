<h1><p class='center'>YESTERDAY’S BAGGAGE</p></h1>
<p><em>For the wise have always known that no one can make much of his life until self-searching becomes a regular habit, until he is able to admit and accept what he finds, and until he patiently and persistently tries to correct what is wrong.</em>
<br/></p>

I have more than enough to handle today, without dragging along yesterday’s baggage too. I must balance today’s books, if I am to have a chance tomorrow. So I ask myself if I have erred and how I can avoid repeating that particular behavior. Did I hurt anyone, did I help anyone, and why? Some of today is bound to spill over into tomorrow, but most of it need not if I make an honest daily inventory.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>A NECESSARY PRUNING</p></h1>
<p><em>… we know that the pains of drinking had to come before sobriety, and emotional turmoil before serenity.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 94</p>
<p><br><br>
I love spending time in my garden feeding and pruning my beautiful flowers. One day, as I was busily snipping away, a neighbor stopped by. She commented, “Oh! Your plants are so beautiful, it seems such a shame to cut them back.” I replied, “I know how you feel, but the excess must be removed so they can grow stronger and healthier.” Later I thought that perhaps my plants feel pain, but God and I know it’s part of the plan and I’ve seen the results. I was quickly reminded of my precious A.A. program and how we all grow through pain. I ask God to prune me when it’s time, so I can grow.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>SERENITY AFTER THE STORM</p></h1>
<p><em>Someone who knew what he was talking about once remarked that pain was the touchstone of all spiritual progress. How heartily we A.A.’s can agree with him.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p p. 93-94</p>
<p><br><br>
When on the roller coaster of emotional turmoil, I remember that growth is often painful. My evolution in the A.A. program has taught me that I must experience the inner change, however painful, that eventually guides me from selfishness to selflessness. If I am to have serenity, I must STEP my way past emotional turmoil and its subsequent hangover, and be grateful for continuing spiritual progress.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE ACID TEST</p></h1>
<p><em>As we work the first nine Steps, we prepare ourselves for the adventure of a new life. But when we approach Step Ten we commence to put our A.A. way of living to practical use, day by day, in fair weather or foul. Then comes the acid test: can we stay sober, keep in emotional balance, and live to good purpose under all conditions?</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 88</p>
<p><br><br>
I know the Promises are being fulfilled in my life, but I want to maintain and develop them by the daily application of Step Ten. I have learned through this Step that if I am disturbed, there is something wrong with me. The other person may be wrong too, but I can only deal with my feelings.  When I am hurt or upset, I have to continually look for the cause in me, and then I have to admit and correct my mistakes.  It isn’t easy, but as long as I know I am progressing spiritually, I know that I can mark my effort up as a job well done. I have found that pain is a friend; it lets me know there is something wrong with my emotions, just as a physical pain lets me know there is something wrong with my body. When I take the appropriate action through the Twelve Steps, the pain gradually goes away.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>LEST WE BECOME COMPLACENT</p></h1>
<p><em>It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels. We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85</p>
<p><br><br>
When I am in pain it is easy to stay close to the friends I have found in the programs. Relief from that pain is provided in the solutions contained in A.A.’s Twelve Steps. But when I am feeling good and things are going well, I can become complacent. To put it simply, I become lazy and turn into the problem instead of the solution. I need to get into action, to take stock: where am I and where am I going? A daily inventory will tell me what I must change to regain spiritual balance. Admitting what I find within myself, to God and to another human being, keeps me honest and humble.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE CIRCLE AND THE TRIANGLE</p></h1>
<p><em>The circle stands for the whole world of A.A., and the triangle stands for A.A.’s Three Legacies of Recovery, Unity, and Service.  Within our wonderful new world, we have found freedom from our fatal obsession.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-A.A. COMES OF AGE, p. 139</p>
<p><br><br>
Early in my A.A. life, I became employed in its services and I found the explanation of our society’s logo to be very appropriate. First, a circle of love and service with a well-balanced triangle inside, the base of which represents our Recovery through the Twelve Steps. Then the other two sides, representing Unity and Service, respectively. The three sides of the triangle are equal. As I grew in A.A. I soon identified myself with this symbol. I am the circle, and the sides of the triangle represent three aspects of my personality: physical, emotional sanity, spirituality, the latter forming the symbol’s base. Taken together, all three aspects of my personality translate into a sober and happy life.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>EXACTLY ALIKE</p></h1>
<p><em>Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89</p>
<p><br><br>
A man came to the meeting drunk, interrupted the speakers, stood up and took his shirt off, staggered loudly back and forth for coffee, demanded to talk, and eventually called the group’s secretary an unquotable name and walked out. I was glad he was there–once again I saw what I still could be. I don’t have to be drunk to want to be the exception and the center of attention. I have often felt abused and responded abusively when I was simply being treated as a garden variety human being. The more the man tried to insist he was different, the more I realized that he and I were exactly alike.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h1><p class='center'>LOVE WITHOUT STRINGS</p></h1>
<p><em>Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89</p>
<p><br><br>
Sponsorship held two surprises for me. First, that my sponsees cared about me. What I had thought was gratitude was more like love. They wanted me to be happy, to grow and remain sober. Knowing how they felt kept me from drinking more than once. Second, I discovered that I was able to love someone else responsibly, with respectful and genuine concern for that person’s growth. Before that time, I had thought that my ability to care sincerely about another’s well-being had atrophied from lack of use. To learn that I can love, without greed or anxiety, has been one of the deepest gifts the program has given. Gratitude for that gift has kept me sober many times.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p><a href=days/240927.html>240927</a></p>
<h1><p class='center'>WITHOUT RESERVATION</p></h1>
<p><em>When brimming with gratitude, one’s heartbeat must surely result in outgoing love.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-AS BILL SEES IT, p.37</p>
<p><br><br>
While practicing service to others, if my successes give rise to grandiosity, I must reflect on what brought me to this point. What has been given joyfully, with love, must be passed on without reservation and without expectation.  For as I grow, I find that no matter how much I give with love, I receive much more in spirit.</p>
