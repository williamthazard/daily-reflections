<h1><p class='center'>LEST WE BECOME COMPLACENT</p></h1>
<p><em>It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels. We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85</p>

When I am in pain it is easy to stay close to the friends I have found in the programs. Relief from that pain is provided in the solutions contained in A.A.’s Twelve Steps. But when I am feeling good and things are going well, I can become complacent. To put it simply, I become lazy and turn into the problem instead of the solution. I need to get into action, to take stock: where am I and where am I going? A daily inventory will tell me what I must change to regain spiritual balance. Admitting what I find within myself, to God and to another human being, keeps me honest and humble.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>THE CIRCLE AND THE TRIANGLE</p></h1>
<p><em>The circle stands for the whole world of A.A., and the triangle stands for A.A.’s Three Legacies of Recovery, Unity, and Service.  Within our wonderful new world, we have found freedom from our fatal obsession.</em>

Early in my A.A. life, I became employed in its services and I found the explanation of our society’s logo to be very appropriate. First, a circle of love and service with a well-balanced triangle inside, the base of which represents our Recovery through the Twelve Steps. Then the other two sides, representing Unity and Service, respectively. The three sides of the triangle are equal. As I grew in A.A. I soon identified myself with this symbol. I am the circle, and the sides of the triangle represent three aspects of my personality: physical, emotional sanity, spirituality, the latter forming the symbol’s base. Taken together, all three aspects of my personality translate into a sober and happy life.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>EXACTLY ALIKE</p></h1>
<p><em>Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.</em>

A man came to the meeting drunk, interrupted the speakers, stood up and took his shirt off, staggered loudly back and forth for coffee, demanded to talk, and eventually called the group’s secretary an unquotable name and walked out. I was glad he was there–once again I saw what I still could be. I don’t have to be drunk to want to be the exception and the center of attention. I have often felt abused and responded abusively when I was simply being treated as a garden variety human being. The more the man tried to insist he was different, the more I realized that he and I were exactly alike.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>LOVE WITHOUT STRINGS</p></h1>
<p><em>Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89</p>
<p><br><br>
Sponsorship held two surprises for me. First, that my sponsees cared about me. What I had thought was gratitude was more like love. They wanted me to be happy, to grow and remain sober. Knowing how they felt kept me from drinking more than once. Second, I discovered that I was able to love someone else responsibly, with respectful and genuine concern for that person’s growth. Before that time, I had thought that my ability to care sincerely about another’s well-being had atrophied from lack of use. To learn that I can love, without greed or anxiety, has been one of the deepest gifts the program has given. Gratitude for that gift has kept me sober many times.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>WITHOUT RESERVATION</p></h1>
<p><em>When brimming with gratitude, one’s heartbeat must surely result in outgoing love.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-AS BILL SEES IT, p.37</p>
<p><br><br>
While practicing service to others, if my successes give rise to grandiosity, I must reflect on what brought me to this point. What has been given joyfully, with love, must be passed on without reservation and without expectation.  For as I grow, I find that no matter how much I give with love, I receive much more in spirit.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h1><p class='center'>OUR CHILDREN</p></h1>
<p><em>The alcoholic may find it hard to re-establish friendly relations with his children. In time they will see that he is a new man and in their own way they will let him know it. From that point on, progress will be rapid. Marvelous results often follow such a reunion.</em>

While on the road to recovery I received a gift that could not be purchased. It was a card from my son in college, saying, “Dad, you can’t imagine how glad I am that everything is okay. Happy Birthday, I love you.”  My son had told me that he loved me before. It had been during the previous Christmas holidays, when he had said to me, while crying, “Dad, I love you! Can’t you see what you’re doing to yourself?” I couldn’t. Choked with emotion, I had cried, but this time, when I received my son’s card, my tears were tears of joy, not desperation.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>FIRST THINGS FIRST</p></h1>
<p><em>Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn this truth:  Job or no job — wife or no wife — we simply do not stop drinking so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence on God.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 98</p>
<p><br><br>
Before coming to A.A., I always had excuses for taking a drink: “She said … , ” “He said … ,” “I got fired yesterday,” “I got a great job today.” No area of my life could be good if I drank again. In sobriety my life gets better each day. I must always remember not to drink, to trust God, and to stay active in A.A. Am I putting anything before my sobriety, God, and A.A. today?</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p><a href=days/240924.html>240924</a></p>
<h1><p class='center'>VIGILANCE</p></h1>
<p><em>We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again:  “Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.” Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.</em>

Today I am an alcoholic. Tomorrow will be no different.  My alcoholism lives within me now and forever. I must never forget what I am. Alcohol will surely kill me if I fail to recognize and acknowledge my disease on a daily basis. I am not playing a game in which a loss is a temporary setback. I am dealing with my disease, for which there is no cure, only daily acceptance and vigilance.</p>
