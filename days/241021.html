<h1><p class='center'>NOTHING GROWS IN THE DARK</p></h1>
<p><em>We will want the good that is in us all, even in the worst of us, to flower and to grow.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-AS BILL SEES IT, p. 10</p>
<p><br><br>
With the self-discipline and insight gained from practicing Step Ten, I begin to know the gratifications of sobriety — not as mere abstinence from alcohol, but as recovery in every department of my life.</p>
<p>I renew hope, regenerate faith, and regain the dignity of self-respect. I discover the word “and” in the phrase “and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.”Reassured that I am no longer always wrong, I learn to accept myself as I am, with a new sense of the miracles of sobriety and serenity.</p>
