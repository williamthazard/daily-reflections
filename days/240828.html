<h1><p class='center'>LIGHTENING THE BURDEN</p></h1>
<p><em>Showing others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. The dark past is the key to life and happiness for others.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-Alcoholics Anonymous, p.124</p>
<p><br><br>
Since I have been sober, I have been healed of many pains:  deceiving my partner, deserting my best friend, and spoiling my mother’s hopes for my life. In each case someone in the program told me of a similar problem, and I was able to share what happened to me. When my story was told, both of us got up with lighter hearts.</p>
