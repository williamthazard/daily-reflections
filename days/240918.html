<h1><p class='center'>LOVED BACK TO RECOVERY</p></h1>
<p><em>Our whole treasured philosophy of self-sufficiency had to be cast aside. This had not been done with old-fashioned willpower; it was instead a matter of developing the willingness to accept these new facts of living. We neither ran nor fought. But accept we did. And then we were free.</em>

<p class='right'>-BEST OF THE GRAPEVINE, Vol. I, p. 198</p>
<p><br><br>
I can be free of my old enslaving self. After a while I recognize, and believe in, the good within myself. I see that I have been loved back to recovery by my Higher Power, who envelops me. My Higher Power becomes that source of love and strength that is performing a continuing miracle in me. I am sober … and I am grateful.</p>
