<h1><p class='center'>LIVE AND LET LIVE</p></h1>
<p><em>Never since it began has Alcoholics Anonymous been divided by a major controversial issue. Nor has our Fellowship ever publicly taken sides on any question in an embattled world. This, however, has been no earned virtue. It could almost be said that we were born with it. “So long as we don’t argue these matters privately, it’s a cinch we never shall publicly. ”</em>

Do I remember that I have a right to my opinion but that others don’t have to share it?  That’s the spirit of “Live and Let Live.” The Serenity Prayer reminds me, with God’s help, to “Accept the things I cannot change.” Am I still trying to change others? When it comes to “Courage to change the things I can,” do I remember that my opinions are mine, and yours are yours? Am I still afraid to be me? When it comes to “Wisdom to know the difference,” do I remember that my opinions come from my experience?  If I have a know-it-all attitude, aren’t I being deliberately controversial?</p>
