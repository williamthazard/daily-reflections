<em>When brimming with gratitude, one’s heartbeat must surely result in outgoing love.</em>

While practicing service to others, if my successes give rise to grandiosity, I must reflect on what brought me to this point. What has been given joyfully, with love, must be passed on without reservation and without expectation.  For as I grow, I find that no matter how much I give with love, I receive much more in spirit.
