# <p class='center'>AVOIDING CONTROVERSY</p>

Others fell apart because of sheer self-righteousness while trying to enforce upon the rest of mankind some millennium of their own specification.</em>

As an A.A. member and sponsor, I know I can cause real damage if I yield to temptation and give opinions and advice on another’s medical, marital, or religious problems. I am not a doctor, counselor, or lawyer. I cannot tell anyone how he or she should live; however, I can share how I came through similar situations without drinking, and how A.A.’s Steps and Traditions help me in dealing with my life.
