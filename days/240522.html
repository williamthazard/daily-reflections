When I was drinking all I could ever think about was &quot;I, I, I,&quot; or &quot;Me, Me, Me.&quot; Such painful obsession of self, such soul sickness, such spiritual selfishness bound me to the bottle for more than half my life.</p>
<p>The journey to find God and to do His will one day at a time began with the first word of the First Step . . . &quot;We.&quot; There was power in numbers, there was strength in numbers, there was safety in numbers, and for an alcoholic like me, there was life in numbers. If I had tried to recover alone I probably would have died. With God and another alcoholic I have a divine purpose in my life . . . I have become a channel for God's healing love.</p>
