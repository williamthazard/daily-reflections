<h1><p class='center'>GIVING WITHOUT STRINGS</p></h1>
<p><em>And he well knows that his own life has been made richer, as an extra dividend of giving to another without any demand for a return.</em></p>
<p class='right'>AS BILL SEES IT, p. 69</p>
<p><br><br>
The concept of giving without strings was hard to understand when I first came into the program. I was suspicious when others wanted to help me. I thought, &quot;What do they want in return?&quot; But I soon learned the joy of helping another alcoholic and I understood why they were there for me in the beginning. My attitudes changed and I wanted to help others. Sometimes I became anxious, as I wanted them to know the joys of sobriety, that life can be beautiful. When my life is full of a loving God of my understanding and I give that love to my fellow alcoholic, I feel a special richness that is hard to explain.</p>
