<h1><p class='center'>A.A.’s HEARTBEAT</p></h1>
<p><em>Without unity, the heart of A.A. would cease to beat;</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-AS BILL SEES IT, p. 125</p>
<p><br><br>
Without unity I would be unable to recover in A.A. on a daily basis. By practicing unity within my group, with other A.A. members and at all levels of this great Fellowship, I receive a pronounced feeling of knowing that I am a part of a miracle that was divinely inspired. The ability of Bill W. and Dr. Bob, working together and passing it on to other members, tells me that to give it away is to keep it. Unity is oneness and yet the whole Fellowship is for all of us.</p>
