<h1><p class='center'>WILLINGNESS TO GROW</p></h1>
<p><em>If more gifts are to be received, our awakening has to go on.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-As Bill Sees It, p.8</p>
<p><br><br>
Sobriety fills the painful “hole in the soul” that my alcoholism created. Often I feel so physically well that I believe my work is done. However, joy is not just the absence of pain; it is the gift of continued spiritual awakening. Joy comes from ongoing and active study, as well as application of the principles of recovery in my everyday life, and from sharing that experience with others. My Higher Power presents many opportunities for deeper spiritual awakening. I need only to bring into my recovery the willingness to grow. Today I am ready to grow.</p>
