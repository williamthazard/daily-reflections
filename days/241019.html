<h1><p class='center'>A. A.’S “MAIN TAPROOT”</p></h1>
<p><em>The principle that we shall find no enduring strength until we first admit complete defeat is the main taproot from which our whole Society has sprung and flowered.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 21-22</p>
<p><br><br>
Defeated, and knowing it, I arrived at the doors of A.A., alone and afraid of the unknown.  A power outside of myself had picked me up off my bed, guided me to the phone book, then to the bus stop, and through the doors of Alcoholics Anonymous. Once inside A.A. I experienced a sense of being loved and accepted, something I had not felt since early childhood. May I never lose the sense of wonder I experienced on that first evening with A.A., the greatest event of my entire life.</p>
