<h1><p class='center'>THE GIFT OF BONDING</p></h1>
<p><em>Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS , p. 63</p>
<p><br><br>
Many times in my alcoholic state, I drank to establish a bond between myself and others, but I succeeded only in establishing the bondage of alcoholic loneliness. Through the A.A. way of life, I have received the gift of bonding – with those who were there before me, with those who are there now, and with those yet to come. For this gracious gift from God, I am forever grateful.</p>
