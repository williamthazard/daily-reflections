<h1><p class='center'>OPENING NEW DOORS</p></h1>
<p><em>They [the Promises] are being fulfilled among us – sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84</p>
<p><br><br>
The Promises talked about in this passage are slowly coming to life for me. What has given me hope is putting Step Nine into action. The Step has allowed me to see and set goals for myself in recovery. Old habits and behaviors die hard. Working Step Nine enables me to close the door on the drunk I was, and to open new avenues for myself as a sober alcoholic. Making direct amends is crucial for me. As I repair relationships and behavior of the past, I am better able to live a sober life! Although I have some years of sobriety, there are times when the “old stuff” from the past needs to be taken care of, and Step Nine always works, when I work it.</p>
