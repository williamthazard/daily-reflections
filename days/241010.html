<h1><p class='center'>FIXING ME, NOT YOU</p></h1>
<p><em>If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 90</p>
<p><br><br>
What a freedom I felt when this passage was pointed out to me!  Suddenly I saw that I could do something about my anger, I could fix me, instead of trying to fix them. I believe that there are no exceptions to the axiom. When I am angry, my anger is always self-centered. I must keep reminding myself that I am human, that I am doing the best I can, even when that best is sometimes poor.  So I ask God to remove my anger and truly set me free.</p>
