# <p class='center'>CENTERING OUR THOUGHTS</p>

<em>When World War II broke out, our A.A. dependence on a Higher Power had its first major test. A.A.â€™s entered the services and were scattered all over the world. Would they be able to take the discipline, stand up under fire, and endure?</em>

I will center my thoughts on a Higher Power. I will surrender all to this power within me. I will become a soldier for this power, feeling the might of the spiritual army as it exists in my life today. I will allow a wave of spiritual union to connect me through my gratitude, obedience and discipline to this Higher Power. Let me allow this power to lead me through the orders of the day. May the steps I take today strengthen my words and deeds, may I know that the message I carry is mine to share, given freely by this power greater than myself.
