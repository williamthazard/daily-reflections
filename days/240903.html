<h1><p class='center'>BUILDING A NEW LIFE, p.255</p></h1>
<p><em>We feel a man is unthinking when he says sobriety is enough.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-Alcoholics Anonymous, p.82</p>
<p><br><br>
When I reflect on Step Nine, I see that physical sobriety must be enough for me. I need to remember the hopelessness I felt before  I found sobriety, and how I was willing to go to any lengths for it. Physical sobriety is not enough for those around me, however, since I must see that God’s gift is used to build a new life for my family and loved ones. Just as importantly, I must be available to help others who want the A.A. way of life. I ask God to help me share the gift of sobriety so that its benefit may be shown to those I know and love.</p>
