<h1>It's Okay To Be Me</h1>
<p>&quot;Time after time newcomers have tried to keep to themselves certain facts about their lives. . . . they have turned to easier methods. . . . But they had not learned enough humility. . . .&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em>, pp. 72-73</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br>
Humility sounds so much like humiliation, but it really is the ability to look at myself – and honestly accept what I find. I no longer need to be the &quot;smartest&quot; or &quot;dumbest&quot; or any other &quot;est.&quot; Finally, it is okay to be me. It is easier for me to accept myself if I share my whole life. If I cannot share in meetings, then I had better have a sponsor – someone with whom I can share those &quot;certain facts&quot; that could lead me back to a drunk, to death. I need to take all the Steps. I need the Fifth Step to learn true humility. Easier methods do not work.</p>
