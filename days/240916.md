# <p class='center'>A NEW LIFE</p>

<em>Yes, there is a substitute and it is vastly more than that.Â  It is a fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous. Life will mean something at last.</em>

Life is better without alcohol. A.A. and the presence of a Higher Power keeps me sober, but the grace of God does even better; it brings service into my life. Contact with the A.A. program teaches me a new and greater understanding of what Alcoholics Anonymous is and what it does, but most importantly, it helps to show me who I am: an alcoholic who needs the constant experience of the Alcoholics Anonymous program so that I may live a life given to me by my Higher Power.
