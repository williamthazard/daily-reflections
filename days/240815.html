<h1><p class='center'>DIDN’T WE HURT ANYBODY?</p></h1>
<p><em>Some of us, though, tripped over a very different snag. We clung to the claim that when drinking we never hurt anybody but ourselves.</em>

<p class='right'>TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS , p. 79</p>
<p><br><br>
This Step seemed so simple. I identified several people whom I had harmed, but they were no longer available. Still, I was uneasy about the Step and avoided conversations dealing with it. In time I learned to investigate those Steps and areas of my life which made me uncomfortable. My search revealed my parents, who had been deeply hurt by my isolation from them; my employer, who worried about my absences, my memory lapses, my temper; and the friends I had shunned, without explanation. As I faced the reality of the harm I had done, Step Eight took on a new meaning. I am no longer uncomfortable and I feel clean and light.</p>
