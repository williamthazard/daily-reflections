# <p class='center'>THE GIFT OF BONDING</p>

<em>Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.</em>

Many times in my alcoholic state, I drank to establish a bond between myself and others, but I succeeded only in establishing the bondage of alcoholic loneliness. Through the A.A. way of life, I have received the gift of bonding â€“ with those who were there before me, with those who are there now, and with those yet to come. For this gracious gift from God, I am forever grateful.
