<h1><p class='center'>SERENITY AFTER THE STORM</p></h1>
<p><em>Someone who knew what he was talking about once remarked that pain was the touchstone of all spiritual progress. How heartily we A.A.’s can agree with him.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p p. 93-94</p>
<p><br><br>
When on the roller coaster of emotional turmoil, I remember that growth is often painful. My evolution in the A.A. program has taught me that I must experience the inner change, however painful, that eventually guides me from selfishness to selflessness. If I am to have serenity, I must STEP my way past emotional turmoil and its subsequent hangover, and be grateful for continuing spiritual progress.</p>
