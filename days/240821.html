<p><em>My stability came out of trying to give, not out of demanding that I receive.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-The Best Of Bill, pp. 46-47</p>
<p><br><br>
As long as I try, with all my heart and soul, to pass along to others what has been passed along to me, and do not demand anything in return, life is good to me. Before entering this program of Alcoholics Anonymous I was never able to give without demanding something in return. Little did I know that, once I began to give freely of myself, I would begin to receive, without ever expecting or demanding anything at all. What I receive today is the gift of “stability,” as Bill did: stability in my A.A. program; within myself; but most of all, in my relationship with my Higher Power, whom I choose to call God.</p>
