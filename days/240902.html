<h1><p class='center'>FINDING “A REASON TO BELIEVE”</p></h1>
<p><em>The willingness to grow is the essence of all spiritual development.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-As Bill Sees It, p.171</p>

A line from a song goes, “ … and I look to find a reason to believe … ” It reminds me that at one time I was not able to find a reason to believe that my life was all right. Even though my life had been saved by coming to A.A., three months later I went out and drank again. Someone told me: “You don’t have to believe. Aren’t you willing to believe that there is a reason for your life, even though you may not know yourself what that reason is, or that you may not sometimes know the right way to behave?” When I saw how willing I was to believe there was a reason for my life, then I could start to work on the Steps. Now when I begin with, “I am willing … ,” I am using the key that leads to action, honesty, and openness to a Higher Power moving through my life.</p>
