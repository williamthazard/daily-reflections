<h1><p class='center'>WITHOUT RESERVATION</p></h1>
<p><em>When brimming with gratitude, one’s heartbeat must surely result in outgoing love.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-AS BILL SEES IT, p.37</p>
<p><br><br>
While practicing service to others, if my successes give rise to grandiosity, I must reflect on what brought me to this point. What has been given joyfully, with love, must be passed on without reservation and without expectation.  For as I grow, I find that no matter how much I give with love, I receive much more in spirit.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>OUR CHILDREN</p></h1>
<p><em>The alcoholic may find it hard to re-establish friendly relations with his children. In time they will see that he is a new man and in their own way they will let him know it. From that point on, progress will be rapid. Marvelous results often follow such a reunion.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 134</p>
<p><br><br>
While on the road to recovery I received a gift that could not be purchased. It was a card from my son in college, saying, “Dad, you can’t imagine how glad I am that everything is okay. Happy Birthday, I love you.”  My son had told me that he loved me before. It had been during the previous Christmas holidays, when he had said to me, while crying, “Dad, I love you! Can’t you see what you’re doing to yourself?” I couldn’t. Choked with emotion, I had cried, but this time, when I received my son’s card, my tears were tears of joy, not desperation.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>FIRST THINGS FIRST</p></h1>
<p><em>Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn this truth:  Job or no job — wife or no wife — we simply do not stop drinking so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence on God.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 98</p>
<p><br><br>
Before coming to A.A., I always had excuses for taking a drink: “She said … , ” “He said … ,” “I got fired yesterday,” “I got a great job today.” No area of my life could be good if I drank again. In sobriety my life gets better each day. I must always remember not to drink, to trust God, and to stay active in A.A. Am I putting anything before my sobriety, God, and A.A. today?</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<h1><p class='center'>VIGILANCE</p></h1>
<p><em>We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again:  “Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.” Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 33</p>
<p><br><br>
Today I am an alcoholic. Tomorrow will be no different.  My alcoholism lives within me now and forever. I must never forget what I am. Alcohol will surely kill me if I fail to recognize and acknowledge my disease on a daily basis. I am not playing a game in which a loss is a temporary setback. I am dealing with my disease, for which there is no cure, only daily acceptance and vigilance.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>“I WAS AN EXCEPTION”</p></h1>
<p><em>He [Bill W.] said to me, gently and simply, “Do you think that you are one of us?”</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 413</p>
<p><br><br>
During my drinking life I was convinced I was an exception.  I thought I was beyond petty requirements and had the right to be excused. I never realized that the dark counterbalance of my attitude was the constant feeling that I did not “belong.” At first, in A.A., I identified with others only as an alcoholic. What a wonderful awakening for me it has been to realize that, if human beings were doing the best they could, then so was I! All of the pains, confusions and joys they feel are not exceptional, but part of my life, just as much as anybody’s.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>A.A. Thought For The Day</p></h1>
<p><em>Like a gaunt prospector, belt drawn in over the last ounce of food, our pick struck gold. Joy at our release from a lifetime of frustration knew no bounds.  Father feels he has struck something better than gold.  For a time he may try to hug the new treasure to himself.  He may not see at once that he has barely scratched a limitless lode which will pay dividends only if he mine it for the rest of his life and insists on giving away the entire product.</em>

<h1><p class='center'>THE LAST PROMISE</p></h1>
<p><em>We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84</p>
<p><br><br>
The last Promise in the Big Book came true for me on the very first day of sobriety. God kept me sober that day, and on every other day I allowed Him to operate in my life. He gives me the strength, courage and guidance to meet my responsibilities in life so that I am then able to reach out and help others stay sober and grow. He manifests within me, making me a channel of His word, thought and deed. He works with my inner self, while I produce in the outer world, for He will not do for me what I can do for myself. I must be willing to do His work, so that He can function through me successfully.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>H.P. AS GUIDE</p></h1>
<p><em>See to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great events will come to pass for you and countless others. This is the Great Fact for us.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 164</p>
<p><br><br>
Having a right relationship with God seemed to be an impossible order. My chaotic past had left me filled with guilt and remorse and I wondered how this “God business” could work. A.A. told me that I must turn my will and my life life over to the care of God, as I understand Him. With nowhere else to turn, I went down on my knees and cried, “God, I can’t do this. Please help me!” It was when I admitted my powerlessness that a glimmer of light began to touch my soul, and then a willingness emerged to let God control my life. With Him as my guide, great events began to happen, and I found the beginning of sobriety.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<h1><p class='center'>ACCEPTANCE</p></h1>
<p><em>We admitted we couldn’t lick alcohol with our own remaining resources, and so we accepted the further fact that dependence upon a Higher Power (if only our A.A. group) could do this hitherto impossible job. The moment we were able to accept these facts fully, our release from the alcohol compulsion had begun.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-AS BILL SEES IT, p. 109</p>
<p><br><br>
Freedom came to me only with my acceptance that I could turn my will and my life over to the care of my Higher Power, whom I call God. Serenity seeped into the chaos of my life when I accepted that what I was going through was life, and that God would help me through my difficulties–and much more, as well. Since then He has helped me through all of my difficulties! When I accept situations as they are, not as I wish them to be, then I can begin to grow and have serenity and peace of mind.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>LOVED BACK TO RECOVERY</p></h1>
<p><em>Our whole treasured philosophy of self-sufficiency had to be cast aside. This had not been done with old-fashioned willpower; it was instead a matter of developing the willingness to accept these new facts of living. We neither ran nor fought. But accept we did. And then we were free.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-BEST OF THE GRAPEVINE, Vol. I, p. 198</p>
<p><br><br>
I can be free of my old enslaving self. After a while I recognize, and believe in, the good within myself. I see that I have been loved back to recovery by my Higher Power, who envelops me. My Higher Power becomes that source of love and strength that is performing a continuing miracle in me. I am sober … and I am grateful.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>FREEDOM FROM FEAR</p></h1>
<p><em>When, with God’s help, we calmly accepted our lot, then we found we could live at peace with ourselves and show others who still suffered the same fears that they could get over them, too. We found that freedom from fear was more important than freedom from want.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 122</p>
<p><br><br>
Material values ruled my life for many years during my active alcoholism. I believed that all of my possessions would make me happy, yet I still felt bankrupt after I obtained them. When I first came into A. A., I found out about a new way of living.  As a result of learning to trust others, I began to believe in a power greater than myself. Having faith freed me from the bondage of self. As material gains were replaced by the gifts of the spirit, my life became manageable. I then chose to share my experiences with other alcoholics.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<h1><p class='center'>WE STAND–OR FALL–TOGETHER</p></h1>
<p><em>… no society of men and women ever had a more urgent need for continuous effectiveness and permanent unity. We alcoholics see that we must work together and hang together, else most of us will finally die alone.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-Alcoholics Anonymous, p.563</p>
<p><br><br>
Just as the Twelve Steps of A.A. are written in a specific sequence for a reason, so it is with the Twelve Traditions. The First Step and the First Tradition attempt to instill in me enough humility to allow me a chance at survival. Together they are the basic foundation upon which the Steps and Traditions that follow are built. It is a process of ego deflation which allows me to grow as an individual through the Steps, and as a contributing member of a group through the Traditions. Full acceptance of the First Tradition allows me to set aside personal ambitions, fears and anger when they are in conflict with the common good, thus permitting me to work with others for our mutual survival.  Without Tradition One I stand little chance of maintaining the unity required to work with others effectively, and I also stand to lose the remaining Traditions, the Fellowship, and my life.</p>

<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 152</p>
<p><br><br>
Life is better without alcohol. A.A. and the presence of a Higher Power keeps me sober, but the grace of God does even better; it brings service into my life. Contact with the A.A. program teaches me a new and greater understanding of what Alcoholics Anonymous is and what it does, but most importantly, it helps to show me who I am: an alcoholic who needs the constant experience of the Alcoholics Anonymous program so that I may live a life given to me by my Higher Power.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>PEACE OF MIND</p></h1>

<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p p. 86-87</p>
<p><br><br>
My belief in a Higher Power is an essential part of my work on Step Nine; forgiveness, timing, and right motives are the other ingredients. My willingness to do the Step is a growing experience that opens the door for new and honest relationships with the people I have harmed. My responsible action brings me closer to the spiritual principles of the program — love and service. Peace of mind, serenity, and a stronger faith are sure to follow.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>REPAIRING THE DAMAGE</p></h1>
<p><em>Good judgment, careful sense of timing, courage and prudence – these are the qualities we shall need when we take Step Nine.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 83</p>
<p><br><br>
To make amends can be viewed two ways: first, that of repairing damage, for if I have damaged my neighbor’s fence, I “make a mend,” and that is a direct amend; the second way is by modifying my behavior, for if my actions have harmed someone. I make a daily effort to cause no further harm. I “mend my ways,” and that is an indirect amend. Which is the best approach? The only right approach, provided that I am causing no further harm in so doing, is to do both. If harm is done, then I simply “mend my ways.”  To take action in this manner assures me of making honest amends.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>A “DESIGN FOR LIVING”</p></h1>
<p><em>We in our turn, sought the same escape with all the desperation of drowning men. What seemed at first a flimsy reed, has proved to be the loving and powerful hand of God. A new life has been given us or, if you prefer, “a design for living” that really works.</em>
<br/></p>
 <p class='right'>-ALCOHOLIC ANONYMOUS , p. 28</p>
<p><br><br>
I try each day to raise my heart and hands in thanks to God for showing me a “design for living” that really works through our beautiful Fellowship. But what, exactly, is this “design for living” that “really works”? For me, it is the practice of the Twelve Steps to the best of my ability, the continued awareness of a God who loves me unconditionally, and the hope that, in each new day, there is a purpose for my being. I am truly, truly blessed in the Fellowship.</p>
]]></description>
<h1><p class='center'>I AM RESPONSIBLE</p></h1>
<p><em>For the readiness to take the full consequences of our past acts, and to take responsibility for the well-being of others at the same time, is the very spirit of Step Nine.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 87</p>
<p><br><br>
In recovery, and through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, I learn that the very thing I fear is my freedom. It comes from my tendency to recoil from taking responsibility for anything: I deny, I ignore, I blame, I avoid. Then one day, I look, I admit, I accept. The freedom, the healing and the recovery I experience is in the looking, admitting and accepting. I learn to say, “Yes, I am responsible.” When I can speak those words with honesty and sincerity, then I am free.</p>

<br/></p>
 <p class='right'>-ALCOHOLIC ANONYMOUS , p. 62</p>
<p><br><br>
My selfishness was the driving force behind my drinking. I drank to celebrate success and I drank to drown my sorrows. Humility is the answer. I learn to turn my will and my life over to the care of God. My sponsor tells me that service keeps me sober. Today I ask myself:  Have I sought knowledge of God’s will for me? Have I done service for my A. A. group?</p>

<p><br><br>
To have courage, to be unafraid, are gifts of my recovery. They empower me to ask for help and to go forth in making my amends with a sense of dignity and humility. Making amends may require a certain amount of honesty that I feel I lack, yet with the help of God and the wisdom of others, I can reach within and find the strength to act. My amends may be accepted, or they may not, but after they are completed I can walk with a sense of freedom and know that, for today, I am responsible.</p>

<p><em>They [the Promises] will always materialize if we work for them.</em>
<br/></p>
<p class='right'>-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS p. 84</p>
<p><br><br>
Sometimes I think: “Making these amends is going too far! No one should have to humble himself like that!” However, it is this very humbling of myself that brings me that much closer to the sunlight of the spirit. A.A. is the only hope I have if I am to continue healing and gain a life of happiness, friendship and harmony.</p>

<p><br><br>
If I accept and act upon the advice of those who have made the program work for themselves, I have a chance to outgrow the limits of the past. Some problems will shrink to nothingness, while others may require patient, well-thought-out action. Listening deeply when others share can develop intuition in handling problems which arise unexpectedly. It is usually best for me to avoid impetuous action.  Attending a meeting or calling a fellow A.A. member will usually reduce tension enough to bring relief to a desperate sufferer like me. Sharing problems at meetings with other alcoholics to whom I can relate, or privately with my sponsor, can change aspects of the positions in which I find myself. Character defects are identified and I begin to see how they work against me. When I put my faith in the spiritual power of the program, when I trust others to teach me what I need to do to have a better life, I find that I can trust myself to do what is necessary.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>SEEDS OF FAITH</p></h1>
<p><em>Faith, to be sure, is necessary, but faith alone can avail nothing. We can have faith, yet keep God out of our lives.</em>
<br/></p>
 <p class='right'>-TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 34</p>
<p><br><br>
As a child I constantly questioned the existence of God. To a “scientific thinker” like me, no answer could withstand a thorough dissection, until a very patient woman finally said to me, “You must have faith.” With that simple statement, the seeds of my recovery were sown!</p>
<p>Today, as I practice my recovery — cutting back the weeds of alcoholism — slowly I am letting those early seeds of faith to grow and bloom. Each day of recovery, of ardent gardening, brings the Higher Power of my understanding more fully into my life. My God has always been with me through faith, but it is my responsibility to have the willingness to accept His presence. I ask God to grant me the willingness to do His will.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>OPENING NEW DOORS</p></h1>
<p><em>They [the Promises] are being fulfilled among us – sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.</em>

The Promises talked about in this passage are slowly coming to life for me. What has given me hope is putting Step Nine into action. The Step has allowed me to see and set goals for myself in recovery. Old habits and behaviors die hard. Working Step Nine enables me to close the door on the drunk I was, and to open new avenues for myself as a sober alcoholic. Making direct amends is crucial for me. As I repair relationships and behavior of the past, I am better able to live a sober life! Although I have some years of sobriety, there are times when the “old stuff” from the past needs to be taken care of, and Step Nine always works, when I work it.</p>

<h1><p class='center'>“WE ASKED HIS PROTECTION”</p></h1>
<p><em>We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.</em>

I could not manage life alone. I had tried that road and failed. My “ultimate sin” dragged me down to the lowest level I have ever reached and, unable even to function, I accepted the fact that I desperately needed help. I stopped fighting and surrendered entirely to God. Only then did I start growing! God forgave me. A Higher Power had to have saved me, because the doctors doubted that I would survive. I have forgiven myself now and I enjoy a freedom I have never before experienced. I’ve opened my heart and mind to Him. The more I learn, the less I know – a humbling fact – but I sincerely want to keep growing. I enjoy serenity, but only when I entrust my life totally to God. As long as I am honest with myself and ask for His help, I can maintain this rewarding existence. Just for today, I strive to live His will for me – soberly. I thank God that today I can choose not to drink. Today, life is beautiful!</p>
